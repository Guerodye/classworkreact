# Collmate app
When college students are looking for a place to live off-campus, affordability is not really an option that is marketed to them. Finding an affordable place is often a word to mouth thing.

* What person am I solving the problem for?

The people I am trying to build the app for are college students. They are young adults, with limited resources, and they need a stable environment to live so they can focus on learning. I understand the narrative that college students have money because of how expensive college is. People assume that if they are in college they in fact do have money. This app would target college students that have limited resources for rent. This includes students working limited hours because of school workload, students below 24 that the federal government doesn't help with housing assistance. This app will also target students with different immigration status and are not able to receive assistance for rent.

* The problem they face

There are already a lot of apps out there to find housing and roommates but anyone can get access to them. The people I am solving the problem for find it difficult to find an app created specifically for them in order to narrow their research and allow them to network with people living the same situation as them.

Another major reason that makes housing expensive for college students is the inability to share a room with other students or tenants because of the occupancy limit fixed by landlords, often only 1 person per room.



* What are the ways low income students use to find apartments today?

I did ask other college students in my college group chat, and they mostly find affordable places through networking with other students, it is a word to mouth situation. Others have to research through the existing various apps to hopefully find something in their price range.  This makes it take a long time before they can get what they are looking for. Those who don’t find affordable housing either become homeless or go back to their parents’ house and miss college semester(s).


* Solution

What would make my app unique is that the people accessing the app would be verified as college students, and it could even verify that they are of low income or any other reason justifying that they are looking for affordable housing. In this case the service on the app would be guaranteed to be delivered exactly to the people that the app is designed for.


The app would reduce the time of research for affordable housing to college students by allowing them to network for that specific reason only (finding affordable housing and roommates) and with people also in the same situation.
The app would allow these college students to see listings allowing at least 2 occupants per room.
